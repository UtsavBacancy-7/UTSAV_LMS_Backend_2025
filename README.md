## 🧩 API Versioning
- This project implements **API Versioning** using `Asp.Versioning.Http` to support backward compatibility and future scalability. Each API endpoint is versioned using URL segment-based routing (e.g., `/api/v1/...`), allowing clients to consume a stable contract while the backend evolves.

🔹 **Benefits:**
- Multiple versions can coexist (v1, v2, etc.)
- Easy deprecation and maintenance of older versions
- Clear separation of logic per version for better traceability
- 📘 Example:
  - GET /api/v1/books
  - GET /api/v2/books
---

## 🔒 Rate Limiting
- To prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage, **Rate Limiting** is implemented using middleware (`AspNetCoreRateLimit`) based on IP address and client identity.

🔹 **Features:**
- Configurable request quotas per IP (e.g., 100 requests per 15 minutes)
- Throttling policy stored in `appsettings.json`
- HTTP 429 (`Too Many Requests`) returned when the limit is exceeded
